Here is a side-by-side rundown of the differences between openSUSE is an Linux-based, open, free and secure operating system for PC, laptops, servers and ARM devices. Linux OpenSuSE Tumbleweed vs. Leaps. Tumbleweed vs. Leaps. OpenSuSE currently offers two different Linux distributions known as Tumbleweed and Leaps. Last Friday the openSUSE community released openSUSE Leap 15 as their newest stable release of openSUSE built from the same sources as SUSE Linux Enterprise 15. Back when this non-rolling-release openSUSE update entered beta at the start of the year we rolled out some preliminary. Can someone who may understand what is happening to OSS give a brief summary please? I am confused about what is happening in future. I think I understand that OSS will move on with the Leap moniker for the next version, which will be 42. What other significant changes will be made in Leap/42. The weekly review: Tumbleweed and Leap  Tweet. There were multiple things that happened this week with openSUSE, but rather than making each happening a short snippet of information on news.opensuse.org, we felt it best to  and the balance of effort required vs eventual worth and reader. For those curious how openSUSE Leap 42.2, which was released last week, compares performance-wise to Leap 42.1 and the rolling-release openSUSE Tumbleweed, here are some benchmarks today for your viewing pleasure. I'm 11 using Linux and I am very picky about distro choosing, should I use leap or tumbleweed. I want to know which one is more popular because.

Edit. openSUSE Leap is a brand new way of building openSUSE and is new type of hybrid Linux distribution.  openSUSE Leap will also complement Tumbleweed better. Because Tumbleweed (TW) is a rolling release I would bet that stability SHOULD be slightly better with Leap, with one vig caveat: openSUSE. openSUSE Leap: This is the freely downloadable ISO version, available from the openSUSE downloads page.  The Factory project is the rolling development code base for openSUSE Tumbleweed, a Linux distribution.

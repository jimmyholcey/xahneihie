So for the next few weeks I'll go through each commander and dive into the lore of their units and abilities, a quick summary of their history (and I mean very quick), and going into why they have the abilities and talents they have. The first three, the free commanders, are very basic, but do have some fun stuff, so let's dig in to the farmboy turned soldiers turned bandit turned. The time of reclamation is upon us!

Wage war across the galaxy with three unique and powerful races. StarCraft II is a real-time strategy game from Blizzard Entertainment I wanted to take a few moments to talk about how certain abilities out-shine others. Most of my game time has been focused on Storm, but there are few non-Storm topics that I'll bring up at the end to hopefully generate some discussion. # Primers Frost primers appear to be the most popular, and most useful abilities in our kit at the moment. In nearly every group interaction with another Storm, (whether that was a random Storm in a Legendary Contract, or friends that also played Storm.

Hey, I'm the author of these threads from a few years ago about Hacking in the game and I shared a few tips on how to report and exposed some hack/boosting clans. - https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/2t8rtw/my_experience_with_hacks_the_truth_and_how_to/ - https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/2tdwgk/the_truth_about_imbaqq_boost_proof_inside/ - https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/7w7fjd/hack_situation_how_to_detect_and_best_way_to_deal/ 2019 Global StarCraft II League Season 3; HomeStory Cup XIX; 2019 WCS Summer: Oceania, SEA Qualifier; 2019 WCS Spring; Ongoing   Units (Legacy of the Void) From Liquipedia StarCraft 2 Wiki This article covers the current multiplayer version. Hey folks, So I had a few people (both online and even strangely offline) ask me to do more lore threads, so hell may as well do another one. This was a specific topic requested by u/Icewind, and it's a good topic that I know is a still sore spot for a lot of people: the canceled third person stealth game StarCraft: Ghost. For those that didn't follow it, StarCraft: Ghost was a shooter/stealth/action game announced in 2006 for Gamecube, PS2 and Xbox. However, years of pushback and radio. Legacy of the Void is a stand-alone expansion for StarCraft II, announced as the third and final part of the StarCraft II trilogy of games (after Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm). It will feature an all new Protoss focused campaign, new multiplayer units, tweaks to existing units Hey folks, Subsourian again. So with another War Chest comes a ton of trivia and cool references packed into the little skin descriptions. I figured I'd go through them all. While I've already gone over the different factions this expansion, I'll give a little TL;DR of what they are and their meaning with a link to the full writeups I did a while ago. Also, since this introduces the lore blurbs for the base building skins too, I'll be including them in these. So lets dig in! ###### Dominion. Blizzard's sci-fi real-time strategy sequel consists of three separate games: The third, Legacy of the Void, will focus on the Protoss. Hey folks, Another Co-op Commander, another lore thread on how much of the little details they packed into it. This time it’s the dark prelate, Zeratul, who commands an army of protoss enhanced with the technology of the xel’naga. Zeratul is one of the more storied protoss, so we have a lot to go through. ###### Dark Prelate Zeratul To preface, Zeratul has an absolutely massive backstory and I’ll try to go through it quickly. For a more detailed history of Zeratul, check out a thread. Starcraft 2: Legacy of the Void trainer and cheats tl;dr yes the simulants had prior lore sort of Hey folks, New War Chest is in the game, which means more lore descriptions for each of the skins. Since I know a lot of people have some passing interest but aren't super into the StarCraft lore, I figure I'd delve into some of the cool stuff this pack brings on the lore front, and the history of these factions. And also to nitpick a bunch of stuff because that's how I live. So we'll go through one pack at a time, and get into why they're.

I wrote my Horner lore up thinking he was a surefire thing and now have egg on my face as I get the Fenix one out. Thankfully the teaser yesterday gave me enough time to finish this. Shows you never put too much stock in leaks. Regardless, Fenix! Without a doubt the most asked for StarCraft character. Fenix was considered one of the most noble protoss praetors and warriors of the Templar Caste to have ever lived. Having fought through the Great War and Brood Based on the feedback we heard from pro players and the StarCraft II Community, we're making some changes with Legacy Damn, this became much longer than I originally thought. TLDR (https://i.imgur.com/p2HYIkW.png) --- I loved Rock n Roll Racing and Lost Vikings before I even cared who Blizzard were. I'll be up front, I'm old enough to remember Warcraft 1 coming out. It was an OK game from what I remember, but Warcraft 2 and Beyond the Dark Portal captivated me. I got into map making and coming up with ridiculous scenarios with friends but it really was just one team with two skins. Then Diablo StarCraft 2: Legacy of the Void.

It it's not Activision fault, it's blizzard greediness fault, suddenly doing niche strategy games wasn't "viable" anymore, so they had to change the model to appeal to more costumers, they left the "well crafted experiences" model that made em praise worthy for a "well crafted mass appealing experiences", and you might think "but that's the same right?" but it's not, one experience is made thinking on what kind of game YOU think would be fun ("The game is fun, if it's not fun, why bother").

It’s been a while, been busy with a few things and delayed a bit with Tychus having come out, but I’ll try to keep these going at least until I get through all of the campaigns. So when last we left off before a brief look at Tychus, we were on Char. Going through the order of mission as shown in Shadow Wars, we’ll be going to Zerus next, the birthworld of the zerg.

Hey all! Keeping up with this series as tiny as it seems to be getting, we’re going into Kaldir now. Not too much to say given the arc is a bit of a nonsequitur for the rest of the campaign. A good amount of the lore here is stuff that doesn’t really connect to the greater universe, but there’s enough to talk about for a short episode anyway;. ###### Kaldir: The Ice Moon Far from protoss space lies the ice moon, Kaldir, a perpetually frozen wasteland orbiting the gas giant Watch the latest and greatest trailers, movies, gameplay videos, interviews, video previews of Starcraft II: Legacy Hey all!

Though I did say in my last post that it may be my last lore post, I’ve at least decided I’m going to do the other half of Mephisto, and if I can motivate myself, get Tyrael done as well. I never brought this up when I did the Mephisto lore post when he was announced, but if I’m being completely honest, I’ve never honestly cared that much about Mephisto. I mean, his Diablo II voice was really cool, but beyond “You’re too late!”, he’s not that memorable. Unlike his brothers, who were final bosse.

Hey folks! Sorry for the delay, was out on July 4th festivities yesterday, so pushed this episode back to today. This week we’ll be going back to basics with the Prophecy arc of the Wings of Liberty campaign, the four missions where you play as the protoss. This is one of the more controversial arcs of the campaign given its more fantasy elements, and some weird story decisions we’ll get into, so we may end up spending a lot of this going into the contradictions this arc raised with the serie.
